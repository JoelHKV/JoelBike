# JoelBike

[The app is deployed to Google Cloud](https://storage.googleapis.com/joelvuolevi/bikeapp/index.html)


## General Information

The purpose of the app is to explore journeys made using city bikes in the Helsinki Capital region. Given the large database of millions of trips, a well-designed data strategy was crucial. This project was initially created as an assignment for Solita's Dev Academy, but the intention is to continue developing it for the fun of it 

## Features

The app heavily utilizes Google Maps, allowing users to:

**Figure 3: Browse stations and view departing/arriving traffic as heatmaps indicating the direction bikes are heading to/arriving from:**

The heatmap data can provide insight into bike traffic patterns and help the bike operator allocate bikes more efficiently.




## Setup

To run the app you will need:
- index.html
- main_bike_app.js
- style.css

You will also need to download and import ```stations_HelsinkiEspoo.json```
or have it delivered dynamically by a cloud function:
```https://jsonhandler-c2cjxe2frq-lz.a.run.app/?action=stations```

Finally, you will need an API key for Google Maps. To run the app locally you can simply create secret.js file as follows (see index.html how to use it):

```
const API_KEY = “API_KEY” 
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = API_KEY;
script.async = true;
script.defer = true;
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

## Technologies Used
The frontend is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and the backend is powered by Google Cloud Functions.


## Data

The station data is converted to JSON format with the station ID as the key. Here is the Python script:
```
import pandas as pd
import json
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\joel_\Downloads\Helsingin_ja_Espoon.csv")
df = df.set_index('ID')
# Convert the DataFrame to a JSON object
json_data = df.to_json(orient='index')
# Open the file for writing
with open("stations_HelsinkiEspoo.json", "w") as f:
    # Write the JSON object to the file
    json.dump(json_data, f)
    
```
The trip data is filtered to meet the following criteria:
- The trip must be at least 10 minutes long
- The trip must last at least 10 seconds
- The station ID must be a positive integer
- The return time must be later than the departure time
- The trip is not already included (multiple items deleted) 

The data is split into three different categories for ease of use:
- Per day (92 files)
- Per departure station ID (approx. 500 files)
- Per return station ID (approx. 500 files)

This results in three times the amount of data but provides it in small, useful chunks for faster fetching. 
Here is the Python script for creating the per day files (station files very similar):

```
from datetime import datetime

df5 = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\joel_\Downloads\2021-05.csv")
df6 = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\joel_\Downloads\2021-06.csv")
df7 = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\joel_\Downloads\2021-07.csv")

df_all = pd.concat([df5, df6])
df_all = pd.concat([df_all, df7])
#startmonth = 5
startyear = 2021
dayinmonth=[31,30,31]
for startmonth in range(5,7):
    for startday in range(1,dayinmonth[startmonth-5]+1):
        df=df_all
        df = df.drop(columns=['Departure station name','Return station name'])
        start_time = pd.to_datetime(str(startyear) +"-" + str(startmonth).zfill(2) + "-" + str(startday).zfill(2) + "T00:00:00")
        end_time = pd.to_datetime(str(startyear) +"-" + str(startmonth).zfill(2) + "-" + str(startday).zfill(2) + "T23:59:59")
        df['Departure2'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Departure'])
        df = df[(df['Departure2'] >= start_time) & (df['Departure2'] <= end_time)]

        mask = df.duplicated()
        df = df[~mask]
        delrows = []
        relreason = []

        for index, row in df.iterrows():
            if df['Covered distance (m)'][index]<10 or df['Duration (sec.)'][index]<10:
                delrows.append(index)
                relreason.append(1)
            start_time = datetime.fromisoformat(df['Departure'][index]).timestamp()    
            end_time = datetime.fromisoformat(df['Return'][index]).timestamp()         
            if start_time>end_time:
                delrows.append(index)
                relreason.append(2) 

            depstatval=df['Departure station id'][index]                
            if not (isinstance(depstatval, (int, np.int64)) and depstatval > 0):
                delrows.append(index)
                relreason.append(3) 
            retstatval=df['Return station id'][index]                
            if not (isinstance(retstatval, (int, np.int64)) and retstatval > 0):
                delrows.append(index)
                relreason.append(4)         

        df.drop(delrows, inplace=True) 

        df = df.drop(columns=['Return','Departure2'])
        df = df.iloc[::-1] # time goes up down
        # shorter names better for json
        df = df.rename(columns={'Departure station id': 'did', 'Return station id': 'rid', 'Covered distance (m)': 'dis', 'Duration (sec.)': 'time'}) 
        df['dis'] = (df['dis']/1000).round(1) # distance in km with one decimal
        df['time'] = (df['time']/60).round().astype(int) # time in min no decimal
        df = df.reset_index(drop=True) 

        if not df.empty:
            filename='bikedata2/' + str(startyear) +"-" + str(startmonth).zfill(2) + "-" + str(startday).zfill(2) + '.json'
            with open(filename, "w") as f:
                filename='bikedata1/' + str(startyear) +"-" + str(startmonth).zfill(2) + "-" + str(startday).zfill(2) + '.csv'
                df.to_csv(filename, index=False)

```

The data files are saved as CSV and uploaded to Google Storage. They are served by a cloud function written in Python, which returns the data in JSON format. The code for the cloud function is here.


```

import functions_framework
from io import StringIO
import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import storage
import json

storage_client = storage.Client()
bucket_name = 'joeltestfiles'
BUCKET = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)

@functions_framework.http
def readcsv(request):

    request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
    request_args = request.args
    if request_json and 'action' in request_json:
       action = request_json['action']
    elif request_args and 'action' in request_args:
       action = request_args['action']
    else:
       action = '2021-05-09'

    filename = 'bikedata/' + action + '.csv'

    blob = BUCKET.get_blob(filename)
    csv_content = blob.download_as_string().decode("utf-8")
    df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(csv_content))

    json_data = df.to_json(orient='index')

    headers= {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
      'Content-Type':'application/json'
    }
    return (json_data, 200, headers)

```

## Room for improvement
- Add more flexibility in browsing trips and stations
- Improve the effectiveness of the calendar pop-up for all types of filtering
- Introduce more filters and sorting options
- Address issues with very small layout sizes
- Enhance the language selection window.
